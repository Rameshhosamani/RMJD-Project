# RMJD-Project
A resume matching project with a job description typically involves comparing a candidate's resume with a job posting to determine how closely the candidate's skills, experience, and qualifications align with the requirements of the job.
This is often done using algorithms or software to automate the process of matching keywords and phrases in the resume with those in the job description.
1. Data Collection
   
Resumes: Gather a collection of resumes in various formats (PDF, DOC, etc.).
Job Descriptions: Collect job descriptions that outline key skills, qualifications, job responsibilities, and company requirements.

3. Data Preprocessing

Text Extraction: Extract text from both resumes and job descriptions.
Tokenization: Break the text into meaningful units, like words or phrases.
Normalization: Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, and perform stemming/lemmatization (e.g., converting words like "running" to "run").
Keyword Identification: Extract key skills, experiences, or certifications that are mentioned in the job description.

4. Matching Algorithm
   
Keyword Matching: Compare the keywords from the job description with the resume.
Synonym Matching: Use a synonym dictionary to catch variations of skills (e.g., "Python" vs. "programming language" or "JavaScript" vs. "JS").
Weighting: Assign weights to specific keywords to prioritize more important qualifications (e.g., required vs. preferred skills).
Scoring: Compute a score based on how many job description keywords appear in the resume.

6. Advanced Techniques
   
Machine Learning Models: Train models to predict resume-job fit based on past hiring data.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use more sophisticated NLP techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to capture contextual meaning.
Pattern Matching: Search for common patterns (e.g., years of experience) to match qualifications more accurately.

8. Output
   
Score: Provide a compatibility score (e.g., 75% match) that reflects how well the resume fits the job description.
Suggested Improvements: Identify gaps between the resume and the job description, suggesting areas where the candidate could improve (e.g., missing a certain skill or certification).
Ranked Resumes: If you are comparing multiple resumes for a single job, rank them according to how well they match the job description.
